      <h2>About Me -Feature Branch - </h2>
      <p>Hi there! I'm a student at FAST NUCES currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I'm passionate about technology and enjoy learning about new programming languages and frameworks. I'm also interested in web development and have experience building websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

        I'm currently enrolled in a DevOps course, which has introduced me to the principles and practices of managing and deploying software applications. I'm finding this course to be very informative and I'm eager to learn more about DevOps methodologies.
        
        My roll number at FAST NUCES is 20K0157. I'm always open to connecting with other students and professionals in the tech industry. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or want to learn more about my work.</p>
